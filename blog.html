            <h2>Personal Information</h2>
            
            <p class="quote">My name is Aqua Raph. For as long as I can remember, I have been travelling near and far away from home meeting new people, enjoying the experiences along the way and suffering the perils of not being close to people I know. I went to school in different parts of Kenya and what I learned in those places cannot be quantified.</p>

            <p>Most of the things you will learn in this blog will have a huge bias to computer science and information in general but I will also share my experiences in the places I travel to.</p>

            <h2>Education and Experience</h2>
            
            <p class="quote">I have a Bachelor of Science(Computer Science) degree that I attained in 2018. During my days as a student and the period after, I spent, and still spend, my time coding. I love networks, information security, data, and web development.</p>
            
            <p>Some of the projects I have participated in creating can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/AquaRaph"> Github</a>. This website is part of the projects I have built as part of my practice but I do hope it will turn into something bigger.</p>
